Project Overview:
-Created a Power BI dashboard focused on monitoring employee activities.
-Tracks presence, work from home, sick leave, paid leave, and half-day data.
-Provides real-time insights for HR professionals and management.
-Facilitates data-driven decisions regarding workforce management and policy adjustments.

Expected Outcome:

The dashboard serves as a valuable tool for HR planning by enabling efficient scheduling. HR can strategically allocate the salesforce, allowing for a rotational work-from-home (WFH) arrangement, where half of the team works remotely on alternate days. This approach contributes to a reduction in required office space, as the office can operate at half occupancy. Alternatively, HR can organize office events such as lunches or tea rounds on days when employees are more likely to work from home, fostering increased employee presence and engagement.This dashboard plays a pivotal role in assisting HR to formulate more efficient plans and strategies, also in optimizing resource utilization.
